<h2 align="center">Objectives of the Project</h2>
Our main objective is to make the project as convenient and accessible as possible within its 
entire content. Convenience and accessibility are the top priorities for many visitors to these 
websites, particularly when it comes to projects, communities, and events they wish to 
participate in or apply for. If a person visits a website and the interface has an untidy or 
unclean appearance, he will probably leave and attempt another method. As a result, we made 
an effort to design a practical and functional website with a simple user interface and a solid 
database with relationships and constraints.
